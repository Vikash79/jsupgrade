High drama unfolded in Maharashtra after senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <p>leader Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister of the state and Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) Ajit Pawar took oath as his deputy early morning on Saturday at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai. Fadnavis and Pawar swore-in just hours after it was almost confirmed that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be taking oath as Maharashtra chief minister on Saturday. Ajit Pawar soon got into the hit-list of NCP, Congress and the Shiv Sena for switching side at the last moment after everything was apparently "finalised". Ajit Pawar was removed as the leader of the NCP legislative party by Saturday evening; he was replaced by Jayant Patil. Meanwhile, the NCP exuded confidence that all of its MLAs will be back. According to senior NCP leaders, everyone except four to five MLAs is in touch with them and that the BJP will not be able to pass the floor test. The drama continued till late night as Shiv Sena Congress and the NCP filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court </p>against "arbitrary, malafide actions/decisions" of Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The apex court heard the combined plea of Sena, Congress, and NCP today at 11.30 am and has issued a notice to all respondents. The hearing will continue at 10.30 am on Monday.
